# BootstrapHW

* Second Homework using bootstrap
* In this assignment to my understanding we had to use bootstrap to recreate the pages from assignment one. 
* The pages had to be responsive an certain sizes.

## Responsiveness

* Thanks to bootstrap, the pages would already have built in responsiveness.
* I had to try and adjust it to the provided sizes.

# Problems

* Since we had to use bootstrap, it would take me a long time to find the components needed to recreate the pages.
* I had to delete stuff from the bootstrap code to try and fit my needs.
* Bootstrap contains a lot of components and I was not sure which to use or if to create my own grid.
* Through out my code I would mix and match grid layouts by making rows and columns, and also just using components such as cards and jumbotrons      from bootstrap.
* Had to add style for colors and also to make sure that the media changes for the mentioned sizes.

## Final Messages
* There is really not much I can say about this assignment since i basically just changed the colors and nothing more.
* I found this assignment a lot harder than having to type out the entire code myself and using google to find the help i needed to write it.
